# QB64

QB64 is a modern extended BASIC+OpenGL language that retains QB4.5/QBasic compatibility and compiles native binaries for Windows (XP and up), Linux and macOS (up to High Sierra).  It looks like they've also recently added the ability to run on Chromebooks.

And for those that don't have a 64bit OS... they apparently not support 32bit installation as well.
