# MMBasic

> MMBasic is a free and open BASIC interpreter for 32 bit microcontrollers.

> It includes floating point numbers, extensive string handling, multi dimensional arrays and structured programming features like do loops, multiline if statements, user defined subroutines and functions.

> MMBasic is generally backwards compatible with Microsoft's MBASIC and implements much of the ANSI Standard for Full BASIC (X3.113-1987).

There is also a [version that works on Windows (XP+)](https://geoffg.net/Downloads/WindowsMMBasic/DOS_MMBasic.zip); no installation required.
