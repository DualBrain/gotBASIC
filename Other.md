These are additional dialects that I've recently found that I'd like to spend more time investigating further.

- [AMOS2](http://amos2.tech/en-us/): After 30 years, [AMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_%28programming_language%29)/STOS are begin recreated by the [original author](http://storyofamos.blogspot.com/) targetting HTML5/Javascript.
- [nuBASIC](https://www.nubasic.eu): nuBASIC is a programming language from the BASIC family, designed by the author, Antonino Calderone, mainly for educational purposes both for C++ developers that can deal with a non-trivial example of modern C++ programming and for beginners, which may get hooked on programming. ([SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nubasic/))
-[DolyeSoft BASIC 2.0](http://doylesoft.com/BASIC/?i=1): DoyleSoft BASIC, is a free, BASIC-like scripting language and IDE for all 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows.

- [Script BASIC](https://www.scriptbasic.org/)
- [Script BASIC (on SourceForge)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scriptbasic/)
- [OxygenBasic](https://www.oxygenbasic.org/): A Compact embeddable JIT compiler that reads C headers and compiles to x86 machine code. Executes directly in memory or creates DLLs and EXE files. Supports overloading and OOP. Currently available for MS platforms. 
- [OxygenBasic (GitHub)](https://github.com/Charles-Pegge/OxygenBasic): BASIC Compiler. Run programs directly, or compile to 32/64 bit binary.  Supports C headers and assembly code.
- [BASIC1](http://www.sydneysmith.com/wordpress/basic1/?fbclid=IwAR3ZQ-9yryCDGDKrC4pQWdZBB8oNKw-DN6U6xB9zMXgKFk8V6_s7sb2mPcU)

## Other...

- [Minsk - Building a Compiler - coded live during streaming via YouTube (GitHub)](https://github.com/terrajobst/minsk): This repo contains Minsk, a handwritten compiler in C#. It illustrates basic concepts of compiler construction and how one can tool the language inside of an IDE by exposing APIs for parsing and type checking. 
- [JAVATARI - The online Atari 2600 emulator](http://javatari.org/)
- [How to Build an 8-bit Computer](https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Build-an-8-Bit-Computer/)
- [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/): A free and easy to use retro adventure game creator for your favorite handheld video game system.

# Shouldn't these projects be in BASIC? ;-)
