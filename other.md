## Dialects

These are additional dialects that I've recently found that I'd like to spend more time investigating further.

- [AMOS2](http://amos2.tech/en-us/): After 30 years, [AMOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_%28programming_language%29)/STOS are begin recreated by the [original author](http://storyofamos.blogspot.com/) targetting HTML5/Javascript.
- [AppGameKit|https://www.appgamekit.com/]: AppGameKit is an easy to learn game development engine, ideal for Beginners, Hobbyists & Indie developers.  From the creators of Dark Basic.
- [BaCon - BASIC to C Converter](http://www.basic-converter.org/): BaCon is a free BASIC to C translator for Unix-based systems, which runs on most Unix/Linux/BSD platforms, including MacOSX. It intends to be a programming aid in creating tools which can be compiled on different platforms (including 64bit environments), while trying to revive the days of the good old BASIC.  
- [Bas 2.5](http://www.moria.de/~michael/bas/): Bas is an interpreter for the classic dialect of the programming language BASIC. It is pretty compatible to typical BASIC interpreters of the 1980s, unlike some other UNIX BASIC interpreters, that implement a different syntax, breaking compatibility to existing programs. Bas offers many ANSI BASIC statements for structured programming, such as procedures, local variables and various loop types. Further there are matrix operations, automatic LIST indentation and many statements and functions found in specific classic dialects. Line numbers are not required. 
- [BASIC1](http://www.sydneysmith.com/wordpress/basic1/?fbclid=IwAR3ZQ-9yryCDGDKrC4pQWdZBB8oNKw-DN6U6xB9zMXgKFk8V6_s7sb2mPcU)
- [BASIC256](http://basic256.org/): BASIC-256 is an easy to use version of BASIC designed to teach anybody (especially middle and high-school students) the basics of computer programming. It uses traditional control structures like gosub, for/next, and goto, which helps kids easily see how program flow-control works. It has a built-in graphics mode which lets them draw pictures on screen in minutes, and a set of detailed, easy-to-follow tutorials that introduce programming concepts through fun exercises. Also check out [The "So you wan tto learn" Project](http://www.basicbook.org/).
- [Basic4GL](https://www.basic4gl.net/): Write programs in BASIC on your PC - then run them on your Android phone or tablet.
- [BBC BASIC](http://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcbasic.html)
- [Blassic](http://blassic.net/): Blassic is a classic Basic interpreter. The line numbers are mandatory, and it has PEEK & POKE. The main goal is to execute programs written in old interpreters, even those that use peculiar control flow constructs or automodifiable code. However, it can be used as a scripting language, and has some not-so-classic instructions. It has graphics modes that are compatible with some classic systems and user defined. 
- [bootBASIC](https://github.com/nanochess/bootBASIC): bootBASIC is a BASIC language in 512 bytes of x86 machine code.
- [Bywater BASIC Interpreter](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic/): The Bywater BASIC Interpreter (bwBASIC) implements a large superset of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC (X3.60-1978) and a significant subset of the ANSI Standard for Full BASIC (X3.113-1987) in C.
- [Decimal BASIC](http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA008683/english/): Decimal BASIC is a programming environment for those who write programs for their own investigation. Decimal BASIC adopts ANSI/ISO Full BASIC as its syntax, because Full BASIC has suitable facilities for those who are unacquainted with the peculiar knowledge about computers.
- [DolyeSoft BASIC 2.0](http://doylesoft.com/BASIC/?i=1): DoyleSoft BASIC, is a free, BASIC-like scripting language and IDE for all 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows.

- [Kaya-BASIC (GitHub)](https://github.com/kankouhin/Kaya-BASIC): Multi-platform BASIC compiler, supports Windows, Linux and MacOS.  (Based on the B++ compiler.)
- [Liberty BASIC](http://www.libertybasic.com/): Programming should be simple, but Windows is very complex.  Liberty BASIC makes programming Windows easy.  You will get a lot done with less work and dare we say, have fun doing it!
- [Mole Basic](https://merty.home.xs4all.nl/mole/): Merty's Own Language Extension basic (MOLE basic) is an interpreter originally written to implement a simple (IF-THEN-ELSE) kind of language, usable in a IBM messaging switching environment. BASIC is choosen because I couldn't think of an easier language to learn wich is so well-known and still usable for small and simple tasks.In time, the program grew and I decided to rewrite it in my own time, strip out all IBM-message switch related commands and release it to the public. Although the source is a bit of a mess right now, using lex and yacc makes it easy to adopt your own command(s) inside it, without bothering about interpreting commandlines and expressions. 
- [MoonRock Compiler and Development Language](http://www.rowan.sensation.net.au/moonrock.html): MoonRock is a BASIC-like language with several extensions. Produces small and tight executables (MS-DOS). 8086, 80186+ or 80386+ code. DOS real mode or DPMI protected mode. Archive includes compiler, ArrowSoft assembler, documentation and sample programs. 
- [nuBASIC](https://www.nubasic.eu): nuBASIC is a programming language from the BASIC family, designed by the author, Antonino Calderone, mainly for educational purposes both for C++ developers that can deal with a non-trivial example of modern C++ programming and for beginners, which may get hooked on programming. ([SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nubasic/))
- [OxygenBasic](https://www.oxygenbasic.org/): A Compact embeddable JIT compiler that reads C headers and compiles to x86 machine code. Executes directly in memory or creates DLLs and EXE files. Supports overloading and OOP. Currently available for MS platforms.

- [RTB - BASIC](https://projects.drogon.net/rtb): Return to Basics, or RTB, is a programming language inspired by the BASIC programming language that was used on the microcomputers of the late 1970s and 1980s.  As well has having an interactive allowing program entry, debugging, listing and so on in the same way as traditional BASIC has with line numbers, it also takes a more modern approach with a full-screen syntax highlighting editor which allows easier program entry without line-numbers, a unified looping construct, multi-line if/then/else statements, named procedures and functions and many more features to list here.  It currently runs on the Raspberry Pi under Raspbian and other Linux systems.
- [Run BASIC](http://www.runbasic.com/): Run BASIC Personal Server is an all-in-one system that makes web programming easy and fun.

SmallBASIC includes trigonometric, matrices and algebra functions, a built in IDE, a powerful string library, system, sound, and graphic commands along with structured programming syntax.
- [thinBasic](http://www.thinbasic.com/): A BASIC programming language for Windows.
- [Tiny BASIC](http://tinybasic.cyningstan.org.uk/): Welcome to Damian Gareth Walker's Tiny BASIC Portal! Tiny BASIC is a subset of the BASIC programming language, originally developed in 1975 by Dennis Allison and others. It was designed for hobbyists who couldn't afford the cost of a full Microsoft BASIC package, or didn't have enough memory to run it. It was meant to be easily extensible, and people extended it from pretty early on.
- [TNT Basic](http://tntbasic.com/): TNT Basic is the easiest way to make your own games for the Mac!
- [Vintage BASIC](http://www.vintage-basic.net/): Vintage BASIC is an interpreter for a programming language of days gone by. A time when every home computer had a simple language called BASIC, and every kid who owned a computer learned it. It is implemented in Haskell, a modern language very unlike BASIC. Lyle Kopnicky constructed it as a way to demonstrate how Haskell's monads could be used to implement BASIC's dynamic control structures. This odd marriage has now produced a fully functional implementation of that old favorite.
- [wxBasic Programming Language](http://wxbasic.sourceforge.net/): wxBasic is an Basic interpreter that is: Free, Open Source (LGPL), and Cross-platform (currently Windows and Linux).
wxBasic can create stand-alone executables by binding together source code with the interpreter. wxBasic is written primarily in C, with some C++ linking it to the wxWidgets library. wxWidgets supplies the cross-platform features. wxBasic runs on Windows using native controls, and Linux using the GTK Library. A Macintosh port is being actively investigated. 
- [XBasic](http://www.maxreason.com/software/xbasic/share.html): XBasic is a comprehensive program development environment that integrates a powerful editor, compiler, debugger, function libraries and GuiDesigner into a seamless working environment that encompasses the whole process of creating fast, efficient, reliable, portable 32/64 bit programs.  See XBasic overview. Compatible and equivalent implementations of XBasic are available for Windows95/98/NT and Linux.  XBasic is written entirely XBasic, plus a little assembly language.  XBasic is open-source freeware released under the standard GPL and LGPL licenses to assure all enhancements and derivatives remain open-source.
