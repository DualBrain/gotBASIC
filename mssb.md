## Microsoft Small Basic

According to the [official website](http://smallbasic.com):

*"Small Basic is the **only** programming language created specially to help students transition from block-based coding to text-based 
coding. By teaching the fundamental elements of syntax-based languages in an approachable manner, Small Basic gives students the skills 
and confidence to tackle more complex programming languages such as Java and C#. You can also build applications for Kinect, Lego 
Mindstorm, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Oculus Rift, and more using Small Basic.

From age 7 to 107, Small Basic is one of the easiest ways to learn to code."*

**Really?!?!**

I'm planning on doing a full video and write up on this product.  Fair warning, this isn't going to be very pretty!  
Although I applaud the effort, it's pretty clear to me that the people (or person) that originally designed the 
language is not someone whom is familar with BASIC.

What follows is not an exhaustive list of "issues" I see, but I believe this gives a bit of a window into why I am so disappointed:

- Application has no automatic update or even any sort of indication that there is a new version available.
- In order to upgrade you have to uninstall/reinstall.
- Methods require that you have parens around the parameters.
- Appears to support the concept of subroutines; however, no ability to pass parameters (so what is the point).  This basically hamstrings the ability to create reusable code or have code that easily be shared/reused. All in an environment that encourages sharing of code.
- Sort of related to the previous entry, all variables are global in scope.
- Arrays don't have square brackets.
- Because TextWindow.WriteLine("Hello World") is SOOOO much better than PRINT "Hello World". ;-)
- Start here so you can move to Java and C#????? What about VB?
- There is the whole "graduate" thing that doesn't work.

Basically I'm saying that this verson of BASIC suffers from a form multiple-personality dissorder.  It's not 100% 
sure of what it actually is supposed to be.

I'm so disappointed with this version of BASIC because it truly holds so much promise that it just falls so short of.  
Outside of the bad decisions around the "language"  implementation... the web-based "IDE" is awesome!  The "intellisense" 
approach is pretty cool.  Having easy and quick access to help is great.  Encouraging (and having it built in) the ability 
to share samples/code.  Top-level code (removal of the ceremony of VB.NET)... awesome!  Like I said... if it weren't for 
some seriously bad things... this would be awesome!
