## Microsoft Small Basic

According to the [official website](http://smallbasic.com):

*"Small Basic is the **only** programming language created specially to help students transition from block-based coding to text-based coding. By teaching the fundamental elements of syntax-based languages in an approachable manner, Small Basic gives students the skills and confidence to tackle more complex programming languages such as Java and C#. You can also build applications for Kinect, Lego Mindstorm, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Oculus Rift, and more using Small Basic.

From age 7 to 107, Small Basic is one of the easiest ways to learn to code."*

**Reall?!?!**

### PLEASE NOTE

I'm planning on doing a full video and write up on this product.  Fair warning, this isn't going to be very pretty!  
Although I applaud the effort, it's pretty clear to me that the people (or person) that originally designed the 
language is not someone whom is familar with BASIC.  More to come...
