# Basic Anywhere Machine

> All-in-one HTML file. BASIC interpreter with a console window.  IDE with CodeMirror + helpful programming tools.  Your BASIC programs.  Your data. The ultimate in portability. Online. Offline.

It is an enhanced version of [Google's wwwBASIC](wwwbasic.md) (a BASIC meant for the web), embedded in (or hosted by) and enhanced by [[TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/).

So a single-file HTML, with IDE, tools, the interpreter, the BASIC programs, on-line/off-line, with various BASIC program export options.
