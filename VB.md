## Where there's a will...

Although Microsoft has done a great job with several technology stacks; there are a few areas where support falls a little short or just doesn't seem to exist.  This section points to areas where you can find "how to make it (mostly) work in VB".

- ILMerge
  - [ILMerge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17630): ILMerge is a utility for merging multiple .NET assemblies into a single .NET assembly. It works on executables and DLLs alike and comes with several options for controlling the processing and format of the output.
