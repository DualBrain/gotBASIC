## Libraries

QuickPak Professional is a programmer's toolbox of more than 500 BASIC and assembly language subroutines, designed to help developers improve the quality of their programs and complete them faster. Included are routines for windowing, access to DOS and BIOS services, searching and sorting any type of BASIC array, creating pull-down and Lotus(r) style menus, accepting data input, and much more. Extensive documentation (700 pages) is provided with additional tutorials on files, arrays, subprograms, sorting, compiling and linking, plus many other related topics. The manual is clearly written, and includes a wealth of information useful and pertinent for programmers at all levels of experience. We provide pre-built Quick and linking libraries for use with all current versions of Microsoft BASIC for DOS--simply load the appropriate library, and you're ready to go. The high-level routines written in BASIC are easily loaded as source modules.
