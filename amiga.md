## AmigaBASIC

![Amiga](images/amiga_logo.svg.png)

AmigaBASIC is a BASIC language implementation for the earlier line of Amiga personal computers, designed and written by Microsoft. AmigaBASIC shipped with AmigaOS versions 1.1 to 1.3. It succeeded ABasiC, which was initially included in AmigaOS 1.0 (possibly even on some early 1.1 disks), and discontinued in AmigaOS version 2.0 onwards.

AmigaBASIC provided not only the common BASIC language, but also attempted to provide an easy-to-use API for the Amiga's unique graphics and sound capabilities. `OBJECT` commands, for example, made it easy to create moving objects - sprites and bobs that could be drawn with an external drawing program, Object editor, that was supplied with AmigaBASIC.
