# ASIC

ASIC is an inexpensive (shareware) compiler that generates very compact, fast-running executable programs that run in a DOS environment. It is a subset of the BASIC language, lacking most of the more complex functions and graphics capabilities of QuickBasic or PowerBasic. The author of ASIC is David Visti. The most recent release of the program is version 5.0 (1994).
