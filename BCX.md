# BCX

BCX is a small command line tool that inputs a BCX BASIC source code file and outputs a 'C' source code file which can be compiled with many C or C++ compilers. 

"Using BCX and a C compiler enables you to produce powerful 32-bit native code Windows console mode programs, windows GUI applications, and Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL's) without having to incur the costs of an expensive commercial BASIC compiler. The programs that you create will be among the smallest and fastest 32 bit executable programs around, requiring no additional distributed runtime modules. 

Although BCX remains a work in progress, it is capable of some very powerful feats. Its ability to use Microsoft Windows structures, variables, and the powerful Win32 API, coupled with its ability to mix "C" code in a straight forward BASIC way, makes BCX a very powerful tool while retaining the relative ease of use by anyone familiar with modern BASIC programming."

NOTE: BCX appears to be at at least version 7.2.6 (see [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/bc9basic/blog/)) as of 2016-02-23; however, not able to find this anywhere on the web.  I'm assuming that it's only available through the "Yahoo Group"; which, I've not been able to get any sort of a response when emailing the admin of that group in the past to get my account flagged as being able to see the files.  Would be so much simpler if they would either a) update
