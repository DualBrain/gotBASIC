## Enhancements/Alternatives

I've just watched [this video](https://youtu.be/ROR1NQE-2DY) and this project looks very interesting. (I haven't used it myself, but it certainly looks pretty good.)

- [Vision BASIC](https://visionbasic.net/)

There is also a Commodore BASIC V2 interpreter/compiler that is written in Java available at [BasicV2](egonolsen71.github.io/basicv2/) and GitHub repo located at [basicv2](https://github.com/EgonOlsen71/basicv2). This looks to be a pretty impressive project that provides cross-compiling support as well as a symbolic 6502 assembler so you can target real C64, VIC20 and possibly even the Commander X16.
