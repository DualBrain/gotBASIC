# Blitz

> Blitz BASIC is the programming language dialect of the first Blitz compilers, devised by New Zealand-based developer Mark Sibly. Being derived from BASIC, Blitz syntax was designed to be easy to pick up for beginners first learning to program. The languages are game-programming oriented but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for most types of application. The Blitz language evolved as new products were released, with recent incarnations offering support for more advanced programming techniques such as object-orientation and multithreading. This led to the languages losing their BASIC moniker in later years.

- [Blitz Basic PC CD-ROM (archive.org)](https://archive.org/details/blitz_basic_pccd/): This appears to be 16-bit; so won't work on a modern Windows installation.
- [Blitz 3D PC CD-ROM (archive.org)](https://archive.org/details/blitz-3d): This does appear to work on Windows 11 x64.
