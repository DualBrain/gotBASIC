# twinBASIC

> twinBASIC is a modern, BASIC programming language, aiming for 100% backwards compatibility with existing [VB6/VBA](vb6.md) projects.  A complete replacement development environment offering significant new features and improvements over the [VB6 IDE](vb6.md).

> Painstaking effort has gone into and continues to go into building a solid and well tested compiler, standard library and debugger.  Most significantly, we try to copy every quirk/feature found in the legacy [VB6 and VBA compiler](vb6.md).
