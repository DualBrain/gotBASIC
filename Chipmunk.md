# Chipmunk (and Gillespie) BASIC

## Chipmunk

## Gillespie

Gillespie Basic for Windows is a new (2018) spinoff from the original 1990's Chipmunk Basic 1.0 by Dave Gillespie. The main story behind the original Chipmunk Basic is that it was written by Dave Gillespie who also later used it to test his P2C (Pascal to C) translator. That is to say, the original Chipmunk Basic 1.0 was programmed in Pascal and converted to "C" for an old HP Unix system known colloquially as Chipmunk -- hence the name.
