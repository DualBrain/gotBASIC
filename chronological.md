## Chronological

### 1956

- John Kemeny creates DARSIMCO (Dartmouth Simplified Code) for the IBM 704; found little traction due to the arrival of FORTRAN at MIT the next year. (See [Dartmouth BASIC](dartmouth.md).)

### 1959

- Dartmouth College purchase a Librascope General Precision (LGP-30) desk-size computer where one student wrote a FORTRAN-inspired language called DART for the LPG-30. (See [Dartmouth BASIC](dartmouth.md).)

### 1961

- Stephen Garland, Robert Hargraves, Jorge Llacer, Anthony Knapp and Thomas Kurtz create Dartmouth ALGOL 30; based originally on ALGOL 58 and then ALGOL 60. (See [Dartmouth BASIC](dartmouth.md).)
- Stephen Garland and Anthony Knapp developed a "load-and-go" system known as SCALP (Self Contained Algol Processor). (See [Dartmouth BASIC](dartmouth.md).)
- ASCII standard begins in May.

### 1962

- John Kemeny and Sidney Marshall (a high school student) create DOPE (Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment). (See [Dartmouth BASIC](dartmouth.md).)

### 1963

- ASCII standard, first edition published.
- The Teletype Model 33 is introduced.
- Work begins on what will be eventually called the DTSS (Dartmouth Time-Sharing System). John Kemeny begins working on the BASIC compiler during the Summer; borrowing time on an existing GE-225 (access provided by General Electric). Michael Busch and John McGeachie begin working on the OS (during the Fall). Project officially begins September; draft specifications published in November. (See [Dartmouth BASIC](dartmouth.md).)

### 1964

- GE-225 hardware arrives on Dartmouth campus in February, operational by mid-March with official hand-over April 1.
- [Dartmouth BASIC 'The First'](dartmouth.md) on GE-225 running on the time-sharing project (not yet officially called DTSS) on "May 1st at 4AM" with three Teletype Model 33's connected.
- [Dartmouth BASIC 'The Second'](dartmouth.md) in September.

### 1965

### 1966

### 1972

### 1973

- David Ahl publishes *101 BASIC Games*.

### 1974

### 1975

### 1976

Stephen Garland creates [SBASIC](dartmouth.md) (a BASIC pre-processor for [Dartmouth BASIC 'The Sixth'](dartmouth.md) providing structured-language support).

### 1980

### 1981

- Computer Science Advanced Placement Committee develops the original Advanced Placement Course in Computer Science... opting for PASCAL (not BASIC).

### 1982

- [Dartmouth BASIC 'The Eighth'](dartmouth.md) (primarily by Stephen Garland).

### 1983

- Kemeny and Kurtz co-founded [True BASIC Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_BASIC); based initially on [Dartmouth BASIC 'The Seventh'](dartmouth.md).

### 1984

### 1985
