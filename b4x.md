# B4X (from Anywhere Software)

The B4X suite supports many different platforms using several editions (B4R, B4A, B4J, B4I) allowing you to build applications in a BASIC compatible (very similar to VB) language for Android, IOS, Windows, Mac, Linux, Arduino, Raspberry Pi and ESP8266/ESP32!

> *Editors Note*: The B4A product is an absolute must have if you are interested in working with *Arduino* devices and prefer writing code in something very, very similar to VB! Highly recommend.
