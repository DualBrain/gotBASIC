Limitations in this tree structure immediately arise in the fact that some dialects are influenced by multiple other dialects. Where this occurs, a single "more influential" dialect is chosen.

Multiple "versions" or "editions" of the same dialect are only included if they are clearly a "major" release and are only done so in the event that another dialect is based on a specific release version.

One of the key deciding factors in determining branch position for an early BASIC dialect is whether or not it supported string functionality; as string support wasn't added to Dartmouth BASIC until "Third Edition".
