# GotBASIC.com

The overall goal of [GotBASIC.com](https://gotBASIC.com) is to be the **GOTO** (<-- see what I did there?) website for __**ALL**__ things related to the **BASIC** computer language; a sort-of one-stop source for every dialect and central hub for all versions (past-and-present) of **BASIC** in all its forms.

[![BASIC Historical Marker](images/historical_marker_modified.jpg)](https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2019/06/11/finally-a-historical-marker-that-talks-about-something-important/)

So please help us help everyone with this project; if you are aware of **BASIC**-related content floating around somewhere around on the web, please let me know.  If you are a product manufacturer of a product related to **BASIC**; please reach out to me so we can work with one another.  If you are working on a project using **BASIC**, please let me know so that I can help spread the word!

And remember...

> You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, but you can’t please all of the people all of the time. ― John Lydgate

BASIC is choosen because I couldn't think of an easier language to learn which is so well-known and still usable for small and simple tasks.In time, the program grew and I decided to rewrite it in my own time, strip out all IBM-message switch related commands and release it to the public. Although the source is a bit of a mess right now, using lex and yacc makes it easy to adopt your own command(s) inside it, without bothering about interpreting commandlines and expressions.

A time when every home computer had a simple language called BASIC, and every kid who owned a computer learned it. It is implemented in Haskell, a modern language very unlike BASIC. Lyle Kopnicky constructed it as a way to demonstrate how Haskell's monads could be used to implement BASIC's dynamic control structures. This odd marriage has now produced a fully functional implementation of that old favorite.
