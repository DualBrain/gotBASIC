# gotBASIC.com

The overall goal of https://gotBASIC.com is to be the **GOTO** (<-- see what I did there?) website for __**ALL**__ things related to the **BASIC** computer language; a sort-of  one-stop source for every dialect and central hub for all versions (past-and-present) of **BASIC** in all its forms.

So please help me help everyone with this project; if you are aware of **BASIC**-related content floating around somewhere around on the web, please let me know.  If you are a product manufacturer of a product related to **BASIC**; please reach out to me so we can work with one another.  If you are working on a project using **BASIC**, please let me know so that I can help spread the word!
