# GotBASIC.com

The primary goal of [GotBASIC.com](https://gotBASIC.com) is to be the **GOTO** (<-- see what I did there?) location for __**ALL**__ things related to the **BASIC** computer language; a sort-of one-stop source for every dialect and central hub for all versions (past-and-present) of **BASIC** in all its forms.

[![BASIC Historical Marker](images/historical_marker_modified.jpg)](https://granitegeek.concordmonitor.com/2019/06/11/finally-a-historical-marker-that-talks-about-something-important/)

So please help us help everyone with this project; if you are aware of **BASIC**-related content floating around somewhere around on the web, please let us know.  If you are a product manufacturer of a product related to **BASIC**; please reach out to us so we can work with one another.  If you are working on a project using **BASIC**, please let us know so that we can help spread the word!

And remember...

> You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of the people some of the time, but you can’t please all of the people all of the time. ― John Lydgate

## Not Quite BASIC (aka BASIC-esque)

Although the following aren't BASIC in the classical sense, many of these have languages that are clearly inspired by (or at the very least, clearly share similarities with) BASIC (credited or not).

- [BlueBasic: BASIC for Bluetooth](https://hackaday.io/project/2386-bluebasic-basic-for-bluetooth): This hackaday.io project contains a BASIC interpreter which can be flashed onto a CC2540 or CC2541 Bluetooth module. Once installed, simple use the Bluetooth Console tool to connect and start coding on the device using good old BASIC.
