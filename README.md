# gotBASIC.com

This project contains "notes" for various BASIC dialects, projects, how-to's, tutorials and retro-computing related projects that will eventually become part of the http://gotBASIC.com website.

The overall (impossible) goal of gotBASIC.com is to be the **GOTO** (<-- see what I did there?) website for __**ALL**__ things related to the **BASIC** computer language; the one-stop source for every dialect and central hub for all versions (past-and-present) of **BASIC** in all its forms.

So please help me help everyone with this project; if you are aware of **BASIC**-related content floating around somewhere around on the web, please let me know.  If you are a product manufacturer of a product related to **BASIC**; please reach out to me so we can work with one another.  If you are working on a project using **BASIC**, please let me know so that I can help spread the word!
